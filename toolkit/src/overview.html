<title>Overview - fx4web toolkit</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>fx4web toolkit</h1>
<p>fx4web toolkit provides utilities for web-programming in Java. Aside
of miscellenious stuff, the main features are ...</p>
<ul>

	<li>client- as well as server-side support for 'conversation' context
	variables. Conversation context is wider than a single request, but
	narrower than a session. Each window can have it's own conversation
	context, but it can also share it with other windows if needed.</li>
	<li>conversion of HTML tables into scrollable HTML tables with static
	headers.</li>
	<li>automatic conversion of HTML listboxes into sloshbuckets (a pair of
	listboxes with a pair of buttons to allow transfering of options in
	both directions)</li>
	<li>A generic DHTML "floating window" showing application generated
	messages. The application delivers the messages in form of a JavaScript
	array variable and the client-side JavaScript generates the HTML UI
	on-the-fly. For web-applications that use JSF, a pre-packaged
	PhaseListener is provided that does all the work. For non-JSF
	applications, one can be written very easily.</li>
	<li>automatic conversion of any HTML element (embedded in current page)
	into a popup such that it can be shown or hidden with one JavaScript
	function call.</li>
	<li>Several other misc. features such as ...
	<ul>
		<li>DHTML code to generate a 'silkscreen' (a layer that blocks user
		interaction the UI).</li>
		<li>centering of any absolutely-positioned element</li>
		<li>make any element 'floating' (draggable window)</li>
		<li>and more ...</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
